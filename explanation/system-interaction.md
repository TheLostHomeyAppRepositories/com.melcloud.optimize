System Integration and Interaction:

1. Continuous Learning Loop:
   - Hourly algorithm uses K and S factors from weekly calibration
   - Stores detailed performance data
   - Weekly calibration analyzes this data to improve parameters
   - Creates self-improving optimization cycle

2. Key Parameters:
   - K-factor: Thermal response coefficient (typically 0.3-0.7)
   - S-factor: Seasonal adjustment (typically 0.1-0.3)
   - Temperature bounds: 18-22Â°C (configurable)
   - Price sensitivity: 5 levels (VERY_CHEAP to VERY_EXPENSIVE)

3. Potential Improvements:
   - Add weather forecast integration
   - Implement occupancy-based adjustments
   - Include time-of-day comfort profiles
   - Add machine learning for pattern recognition
   - Implement multi-zone optimization
   - Add predictive pre-heating/cooling
