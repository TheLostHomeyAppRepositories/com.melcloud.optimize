## 📊 DETAILED CODE ANALYSIS

### 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUES (Priority 1)

#### 1. Mixed JavaScript/TypeScript Architecture
**Files:** `api.js`, `timeline-helper-wrapper.js`  
**Impact:** High - Type safety compromised, difficult debugging

**Problems:**
- Critical API layer (`api.js`) is still in JavaScript while services are TypeScript
- No type checking on API boundaries
- Inconsistent error handling patterns between JS and TS layers
- Potential runtime type errors at integration points

**Evidence from code:**
```javascript
// api.js - Line 1: JavaScript in TypeScript project
// We can't import the TypeScript services directly in the API
```

#### 2. Complex Optimizer Class with Too Many Responsibilities
**File:** `src/services/optimizer.ts` (1916 lines)  
**Impact:** Critical - Single point of failure, hard to test/maintain

**Problems:**
- Optimizer class handles 15+ different responsibilities
- Complex price optimization, COP calculations, thermal modeling, hot water scheduling
- Methods over 200 lines long
- Deeply nested async/await chains
- Hard to unit test individual components

**Evidence:**
```typescript
// Lines 961-1091: 130-line method with nested async operations
private async calculateOptimalTemperatureWithRealData(...)

// Lines 1436-1647: 211-line enhanced optimization method
async runEnhancedOptimization(): Promise<EnhancedOptimizationResult>
```

#### 3. Memory Management Issues in Thermal Model Service
**File:** `src/services/thermal-model/thermal-model-service.ts`  
**Impact:** Critical - Memory leaks, potential app crashes

**Problems:**
- Confirmed memory leaks as documented in MEMORY_MANAGEMENT_TASKS.md
- No proper cleanup of intervals on service stop
- Data accumulation without bounds checking
- Emergency cleanup only triggers at 80% (too late)

**Evidence from analysis:**
- Memory management tasks document lists critical P0 issues
- Emergency cleanup at 75% memory usage (line 295 in data-collector)
- No timeout tracking for setTimeout calls

#### 4. Poor Error Handling and Type Safety
**Files:** Multiple optimization files  
**Impact:** High - Runtime crashes, difficult debugging

**Problems:**
- Inconsistent error handling patterns across services
- Many `any` types used instead of proper typing
- Silent failures in async operations
- No circuit breaker pattern for external API calls

**Evidence:**
```typescript
// Lines 853-857: Using any types with legacy field handling
const realHeatingCOP = ((energyData.heatingCOP ?? energyData.averageCOP ?? energyData.AverageHeatingCOP) as number) || 0;
```

#### 5. Deprecated Patterns and Legacy Code
**Files:** Multiple  
**Impact:** Medium-High - Technical debt, maintenance burden

**Problems:**
- Legacy field handling for backward compatibility
- Deprecated package dependencies
- Old API patterns mixing with new ones
- TODO comments indicating unfinished refactoring

**Evidence:**
```typescript
// Line 929: Legacy field handling
// Prefer explicit fields if present, then averageCOP, then legacy Average* fields

// Multiple deprecated packages in package-lock.json
"deprecated": "Glob versions prior to v9 are no longer supported"
```

#### 6. Race Conditions in Async Operations
**Files:** `optimizer.ts`, `thermal-model-service.ts`  
**Impact:** High - Data corruption, inconsistent state

**Problems:**
- Multiple async operations modifying shared state
- No proper synchronization in data collection
- Potential race conditions in COP calculations
- Concurrent access to thermal data without locking
