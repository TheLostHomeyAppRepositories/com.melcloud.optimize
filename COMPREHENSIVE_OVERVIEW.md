## Software Architect Perspective

### 🏗️ System Architecture

#### Core Design Patterns

1. **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)**
   - Modular services for each external integration
   - Clear separation of concerns between APIs, optimization logic, and thermal modeling
   - Circuit breaker pattern for API reliability

2. **Event-Driven Architecture**
   - Cron-based scheduling for optimization cycles
   - Settings change listeners for dynamic reconfiguration
   - Timeline-based logging for user feedback

3. **Repository Pattern**
   - Centralized data storage in Homey settings
   - Thermal model persistence across app restarts
   - Historical data management with retention policies

#### System Components

```

#### Scalability Considerations

1. **Memory Management**
   - Thermal data cleanup every 12 hours

### 🏠 Thermal Model Intelligence

The thermal model is the core intelligence of the system, learning the specific characteristics of each building:

#### Learning Process
1. **Data Collection** - Every optimization cycle collects:
   - Indoor/outdoor temperatures
   - Target temperature and actual temperature
   - Weather conditions (wind, humidity, clouds)
   - Heating system status and power consumption

2. **Pattern Recognition** - Analyzes relationships between:
   - Temperature changes and external conditions
   - Heating effectiveness under different circumstances
   - Time-based thermal behaviors

3. **Model Refinement** - Continuously updates:
   - Heating rate (how fast the building warms up)
   - Cooling rate (how fast it loses heat)
   - Thermal mass (building's heat retention capacity)
   - Weather impact factors

#### Strategic Decision Making
