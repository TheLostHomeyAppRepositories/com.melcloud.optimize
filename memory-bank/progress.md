# Progress: Heat Pump Optimizer (Post-Initial Fixes)

**Current Status:** Initial set of identified issues addressed. Code compiled successfully. Ready for testing.

**What Works:**
*   **Core App Structure:** `src/app.ts` contains the main application logic.
*   **Scheduling:** Hourly optimization and weekly calibration are scheduled using `cron`.
*   **API Integration:**
    *   Tibber: Fetches prices successfully.
    *   MELCloud: Logs in, lists devices, reads indoor/target temperature and power status, **and now sets the target temperature (`SetAta`)**.
    *   OpenAI: Sends data for weekly calibration and parses the response.
*   **Optimization Logic:** Calculates target temperature based on price level (VERY_CHEAP, CHEAP, EXPENSIVE, VERY_EXPENSIVE) and a refined K-factor model.
*   **Calibration Logic:** Sends logs to OpenAI weekly to refine K and S factors (requires 48+ log entries).
*   **State Management:** Uses Homey settings to store credentials, model parameters, and logs.
*   **Logging & Feedback:** Provides logs, notifications, and timeline entries for operations and errors.
*   **Dependencies & Build:** `package.json` updated, dependencies installed, and code compiles via `npm run build`.

**What's Left to Build / Future Improvements:**
*   **User Device Selection:** Implement a mechanism (likely in app settings) for the user to explicitly select the target MELCloud device instead of relying on name/ID guessing.
*   **'S' Factor Integration:** Incorporate the 'S' factor (static heat loss/gain) from the weekly calibration into the hourly target temperature calculation for potentially more accurate adjustments.
*   **Advanced Thermal Model:** Explore more sophisticated thermal modeling if the current K/S model proves insufficient.
*   **UI/Settings Enhancements:** Improve the settings page (e.g., device selection dropdown, clearer display of current model parameters, log viewer).
*   **Robustness:** Add more comprehensive testing (unit/integration). Further refine error handling for edge cases (e.g., network timeouts, unexpected API responses).

**Resolved Issues:**
*   **Heat Pump Control:** Implemented `SetAta` call.
*   **Scheduling:** Switched from `setInterval` to `cron`.
*   **Device Selection:** Improved logic with fallbacks (though user selection is still preferred).
*   **Thermal Model:** Refined K update, step calculation, added more price levels for adjustment.
*   **Calibration:** Improved prompts, data requirements, and parsing.
*   **Typing:** Added interfaces, reduced `any`.
*   **Validation/Errors:** Improved settings validation and API error reporting.
*   **Dependencies:** Corrected `cron` type issues.

**Known Issues / Current Limitations:**
*   Device selection still relies on fallbacks if 'Boiler' or numeric ID isn't found.
*   'S' factor is calibrated but not used in hourly calculations.

**Project Evolution / Decisions:**
*   Prioritized implementing the core heat pump control (`SetAta`).
*   Switched to `cron` for reliable scheduling.
*   Refined existing algorithms (K-factor, step) for better stability and logic.
*   Improved prompts and data requirements for OpenAI calibration.
*   Enhanced type safety and error reporting.
*   **Manual Triggers:** Corrected the logic in `registerManualTriggers` to properly handle the manual trigger buttons in the settings page.
