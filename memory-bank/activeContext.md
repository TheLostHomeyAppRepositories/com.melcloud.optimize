# Active Context: Heat Pump Optimizer (Post-Initial Fixes)

**Current Focus:** Addressing the initial set of issues identified after reviewing the base code.

**Recent Changes:**
*   **Dependencies:** Added `cron` dependency, removed deprecated `@types/cron`. Ran `npm install`.
*   **Scheduling:** Replaced `setInterval` logic with `cron` package for precise hourly and weekly job scheduling (`scheduleJobs` method). Uses Homey's timezone.
*   **Heat Pump Control:** Implemented the MELCloud `SetAta` API call within `runHourlyOptimizer` to actually set the calculated target temperature (`newT`) on the heat pump. Includes checks for device power status and avoids sending commands if the target hasn't changed significantly.
*   **Typing:** Added TypeScript interfaces for MELCloud, Tibber, and OpenAI API responses (`MelCloudLoginResponse`, `MelCloudDevice`, `TibberApiResponse`, `OpenAiApiResponse`, etc.) and applied them to `fetch` results and relevant variables, reducing the use of `any`.
*   **Device Selection:** Improved MELCloud device finding logic to prioritize 'Boiler', then first numeric ID, then fallback to the first device found, with warnings. *Note: User selection via settings is still the recommended future improvement.*
*   **Thermal Model:**
    *   Refined K-factor update logic for more stability (smaller learning rate, avoids division by near-zero `dSet`).
    *   Adjusted temperature step calculation (`step = TEMP_STEP_MAX * K`) so smaller K (less responsive) results in a smaller step.
    *   Added adjustments for 'CHEAP' and 'EXPENSIVE' price levels (half-step).
    *   Target temperature rounded to nearest 0.5Â°C.
*   **Weekly Calibration:**
    *   Improved OpenAI system and user prompts for better context.
    *   Increased minimum required log entries to 48 (2 days).
    *   Improved parsing of OpenAI response ("K=x.xxx, S=y.yyy").
    *   Added logging/tracking of previous S value.
*   **Error Handling & Validation:**
    *   Improved `validateSettings` to check for non-empty strings.
    *   Added more detailed error messages for API failures, including response text.
    *   Added validation for OpenAI API key presence before attempting calibration.
    *   Fixed TypeScript errors introduced during refactoring (duplicate variables, incorrect assignments).
*   **Build:** Successfully compiled the updated TypeScript code using `npm run build`.

**Next Steps:**
*   Update `progress.md`.
*   Inform the user that the fixes are implemented and the app is ready for testing (`homey app run` or `homey app install`).
*   Address remaining potential improvements (e.g., user device selection, potentially using the 'S' factor).

**Active Decisions & Considerations:**
*   The app now actively controls the heat pump target temperature.
*   Scheduling is more robust using `cron`.
*   The thermal model and calibration logic have been refined, but the 'S' factor is still not actively used in the hourly calculation (only calibrated weekly).
*   Device selection is improved but still relies on fallbacks; user configuration is ideal.
*   API interactions now have better typing and error reporting.
*   **Manual Triggers:** Modified `registerManualTriggers` to correctly handle the manual trigger buttons in the settings page.

**Learnings & Insights:**
*   Implementing the `SetAta` command was crucial.
*   Using proper scheduling (`cron`) is important for reliability.
*   Iterative refinement of model logic and API interactions improves robustness.
*   Careful dependency management (`@types/cron`) is necessary.
*   Understanding the intended behavior of Homey settings (toggle vs. single set) is important for implementing manual triggers correctly.

**Important Patterns & Preferences:**
*   Use `cron` for scheduling.
*   Use specific TypeScript types for API interactions.
*   Implement actual device control commands (`SetAta`).
*   Validate settings thoroughly.
*   Refine algorithms (K-factor, step calculation) based on expected behavior.
*   Provide detailed logging and user feedback.
